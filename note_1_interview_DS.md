## Notes 

### 1. Tell me about yourself.

* Tell the interviewer only facts that you want  him/her to know
* Give a hint about your personal life with one or two sentences (“I was born and raised in the UK”, “I moved to New York because it is a vibrant city and I like the dynamic environment.”)
*  Show that you are a perfect fit for the job under consideration, you have the right education, and your previous work experiences will be a valuable asset to the firm;
*  Conclude by explaining why you are excited about this possibility and how your strengths match with the profile that the company is looking for

### 2. What relevant work experience do you have?

> Carefully study the job description and identify how your work experience is going to be useful in handing the responsibilities at this new position. Try to be specific and point out, which are the activities that you learned to do in your previous jobs and how they would allow you to perform well at this new position.

### 3. Where do you see yourself in 5 years? (Warning)

By spinning the question in this direction, you are able to achieve three things. 

- First, you protect yourself form answering a potentially dangerous question. 
- Second, you will be able to emphasize that the main driver in your career is professional growth and self-improvement. 
- And third - you are able to affirm that you are excited about the job opportunity. 

Similar versions of this question are:

-  “What do you want to achieve in your career?”, 
- “Describe your ideal job”, 
- “What are your long-term career goals?” 

The same logic applies to all of these questions too.

### 4. How do data scientists use statistics?

> The data scientist job to  do statistical preprocessing. Here we're got creation of dummy variables, feature scaling, regularization, and so on. While preprocessing tasks in their execution, they required solid statistical knowledge.

### 5. What’s the difference between SAS, R, And Python Programming?

- SAS - is expensive tools
- R - Is open source, special focus in statistics 
- Python - Is open source, multi-purpose programming language.

### 6. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING clause in SQL?

Adding a **WHERE** clause to a query allows you to set a condition which you can use to specify what part of the data you want to retrieve from the database. HAVING is a clause frequently implemented with GROUP BY because it refines the output from records that do not satisfy a certain condition.

**HAVING** needs to be inserted between the **GROUP BY** and **ORDER BY** clauses. In a way, HAVING is like WHERE but applied to the GROUP BY block.

> The **main distinction** between the two clauses is HAVING can be applied for subsets of aggregated groups, while in the WHERE block, this is for bidden. In other words, after HAVING, you can have a condition with an aggregate function, while WHERE  cannot use aggregate functions within its condition

### 7. What is a Normal distribution?

> A distribution is a function that shows the possible values for a variable and how often they occur.

A Normal distribution, also known as Gaussian distribution, or The Bell Curve, is probably the most common distribution. 

There are several important reasons:      

- It approximates a wide variety of random variables

- Distributions of sample means with large enough sample sizes could be approximated to Normal, following the **Central Limit Theorem**

### 9. What is an example of a dataset with a non-Gaussian distribution?

> One of the popular non-Gaussian instances is the distribution of the household income in the USA .
> You can see where the 50th percent line is, but that is not where the mean is. While the graph is from 2014, this pattern of inequality still persists and even deepens in the United States. As such, house- hold income in the US is one of the most commonly quoted non-Gaussian distributions in the world.

### 10. R has several packages for solving a particular problem.

#### How do you decide which one is best to use?

> R has extensive documentation online. There is usually a comprehensive guide for the use of popular packages in R, including the analysis of concrete data sets. These can be useful to find out which approach is best suited to solve the problem at hand.

### 11. What are interpolation and extrapolation?

> Say the range of values we’ve got is in the interval (a, b). If the values we are predicting are inside the interval (a, b), we are talking about interpolation (inter = between). If the values we are predicting are outside the interval (a, b), we are talking about extrapolation (extra = outside).

### 12. What is the difference between population and sample in data?

> A population is the collection of all items of interest to our study and is usually denoted with an uppercase N. The numbers we’ve obtained when a population are called parameters.****
>
> A sample is a subset of the population and is denoted with a **lowercase n**, and the numbers we’ve obtained when working with a sample are called statistics.

### 13. What are the steps in making a decision tree?

1. Start the tree. In other words, find the starting state - maybe a question or idea, depending on your context.
2. Add branches. Once you have a question or an idea, it branches out into 1.2, or many different branches. 
3. Add Leaves. Each branch ends with a leaf. The leaf is the state which you will reach once you have followed a branch. 
4. Repeat 2 and 3. We then repeat steps 2 and 3, where the starting pints are the leaves, until we finish-off the tree. In other words, every question and possible outcome should be included. 

### 14. How is machine learning deployed in real-world scenarios?

Now, there are 3 important steps:

1. The general ‘Pythonic’ ways are through pickle or joblib.
2. Computing instance. AWS and Microsoft Azure offer computing instances or cloud-based
   environments that can run the model you’ve just created
3. Job scheduler. Having a model and a place to run it. 

### 15. What is K-means clustering? How can you select K for K-means?

The main goal of clustering is to group individual observations so that the observations from one group are very similar to each other. In addition, we'd like them to be very different form the observations in other groups. There are two main types of clustering: flat and hierarchical. 

It consists of finding K clusters, given their mean distance from the centers of the clusters. K stands for the number of clusters we are trying to identify. This is a value, selected prior to the clustering.



### 16. What are the disadvantages of a linear model?

1. Linear model implies linear relationships.
2. Data must be independent.
3. Outliers are a big, big issue.

### 17. Describe a time when you were under pressure.

### 18. How would you add value  to our company?
